# ArtistAnalysisMIR-LedZepvsGretaVanFleet
Greta Van Fleet - an upcoming band won the best new award at the LoudWire Music Awards. The band recieved a lot of critical 
acclaim and also an interesting question - How is it that you sound a lot like Led Zeppelin. The band responded by saying that
Led Zeppelin was very instrumental in the making of their band and also a great source of inspiration while making music. 

This project attempts to use a one class SVM to plot the two artist's entropies to see how similar the artists' music really is.

The Datasets were obtained using Spotify's API. This provided the required musical features for analysis. The csv datasets were
obtained by using a scraper with the Spotify API. Spotipy, a library in python was used in order to create the scraper.
